## Core Features:

- User Dashboard: Display weekly water usage summary in an intuitive dashboard for individual users.
- Admin Dashboard: Provide an admin dashboard to manage user allocations and monitor overall water consumption.
- Data Visualization: Visualize water usage data through charts (bar, donut) to show trends and allocation status.
- Usage Tracking: Enable users to view their weekly water allocation, water used, and remaining water in gallons.
- Allocation Management: Allow admins to update water allocations per share, ensuring fair distribution among users.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light, muted sky blue (#87CEEB). This evokes the feeling of water, and supports the subject matter without being too bold.
- Background color: Very light desaturated blue (#F0F8FF). This 'almost white' will keep the focus on the content.  
- Accent color: A soft orange color (#FFB347).  It is chosen for good contrast to the sky-blue primary, while also harmonizing and being relatively non-jarring
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, provides a clean, modern look.
- Use Font Awesome icons to represent key metrics and navigation elements, ensuring clarity.
- Implement a responsive grid layout to adapt to different screen sizes.
- Use subtle transitions for progress bars and chart updates to enhance user engagement.
